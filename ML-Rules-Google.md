**Rule #1: Donâ€™t be afraid to launch a product without machine learning.**
- ML requires a lot of data. If not available, **try heuristics**. They can already get you far.
--> **"If machine learning is not absolutely required for your product, don't use it until you have data."**

**Rule #2: First, design and implement metrics.**
- try to track as much as possible --> track changes, notice problems (+ track it)
- design with metric instrumentation in mind

**Rule #3: Choose machine learning over a _complex_ heuristic.**
- complex heuristics are unmaintainable
- when you have the data & understanding of what to do, move the ML (they are easier to update & maintain)
